# My Portfolio

By Tyler Pottle.

## Description

This is my personal portfolio/blog with some basic information about me, my personal
contact information, a blog, and also some personal projects. I also added
functionality to the blog to allow users to sign up, log in, manage their own
posts, and also sign out.  Each post has a tag to indicate who the author was
by their email address.  I have also included different policies for users:
editors can view, edit, and delete both published and unpublished posts.
Authors can view published posts and edit their own unpublished posts.
Visitors(non-signed up users) can only view published posts and have no
create, edit, or delete authorizations.  This policy system was created with
the use the [pundit gem](https://github.com/elabs/pundit)
