# My Portfolio

By Tyler Pottle.

## Description

This is my personal portfolio/blog with some basic information about me, my personal
contact information, a blog, and also some personal projects. I also added
functionality to the blog to allow users to sign up, log in, manage their own
posts, and also sign out.  Each post has a tag to indicate who the author was
by their email address.
